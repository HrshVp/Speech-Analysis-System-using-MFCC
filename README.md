# 🎙️ Automatic Speaker Recognition using MFCC | Streamlit App

This project implements a real-time **speaker recognition system** using **Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs)** for speech feature extraction. It includes a custom DSP pipeline and an interactive **Streamlit** web app for visualizing and experimenting with audio signals.
